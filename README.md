# chartslib
Java library for making charts

ChartsLib is a library created by us in Java which allows user to create 8 different types of charts with user’s custom data and customize them. User can customize the charts in different ways: disable/enable title or legend on the right, change the fonts and the color of the background, set the vertical and horizontal align of the title. Each different charts has also it’s own customization for example PointChart can change the step type of separators on the axis, the distance between them, points size etc.

Our library also provides the option to save the drew charts to a file with 4 file formats: PNG, BMP, JPG and PDF (vectorially).

The ChartsLib was created with the base of Processing library, which let us create simple elements like lines, circles, polygons etc and save the results to a file.
